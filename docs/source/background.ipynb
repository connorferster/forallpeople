    "`forallpeople` implements the SI unit system in a single Python class called, `Physical`, as in \"a physical quantity\".\n",

    "It is intended for folks who routinely perform calculations within a single, typical, unit context and with limited precision requirements. This is common among engineers working within a single discipline (e.g. electrical, mechanical, or civil engineering, etc.) but may be less common to scientists who may be working between different unit contexts with precisions that may or may not carry uncertainties (other units packages, such as pint, may be more suitable for those applications). \n",
    "\n",
    "`forallpeople` assumes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Floating point numbers are going to be used for calculation and their precision is generally adequate\n",
    "* A physical quantity with a given set of dimensions will always represent the same phenomenon\n",
    "    * e.g. One context may be that a `Physical` with `Dimensions(kg=1, m=2, s=-2, A=0, cd=0, K=0, mol=0)` will always represent a \"torque\" (say, in `N*m`) but will never be considered as \"energy\" (say, in `J`). However, another context could consider a `Physical` with the same dimensions always as \"energy\" in joules and never as a \"torque\". `forallpeople` would never consider the dimensions to represent the phenomena of both \"energy\" and \"torque\" at the same time.\n",
    "    * This is consistent with the application of derived units as described in the [SI brochure](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure) (pg. 140, 9th ed.)\n"

The [SI units brochure](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure) recommends \"that the quantities called \"frequency\", \"angular frequency\", and \"angular velocity\" always be given explicit units of Hz or rad/s and not `s⁻¹`.\" However, this can be _partially_ managed within `forallpeople` through the unit environment definitions.
