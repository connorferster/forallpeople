    "`forallpeople` uses specific words to describe aspects of the SI unit system and its own inner workings. The following are some terms and definitions that may aid in understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __\"quantity\"__ and __\"physical quantity\"__: A scalar representation of a physical phenomenon that can have its magnitude and type described in the SI base units (e.g. mass, force, length, time, electric current, etc.) It consists of a number and a unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __\"unit\"__: A name and/or symbol given to a quantity that describes its dimensional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __\"Derived unit\"__: As defined by the BIPM: \"Derived units are defined as products of powers of the base units.\" Examples include newton, hertz, pascal, joule, watt, volt, etc. These can be found in the [SI brochure](https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure) (pg. 137 in the 9th ed.). Note, that `forallpeople` does not define dimensionless units including the ones found in the SI brochure. These include the radian and the steradian. Similarly, the dimensionless angular \"degree\" is not defined in `forallpeople`. Please see [Background - No \"Dimensionless\" definitions](Background.ipynb#No-dimensionless-definitions) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __\"Defined unit\"__: A term used internally within `forallpeople` to describe a unit that is defined within a non-SI unit system but a unit system that is _defined_ by the SI unit system. The most well-known of these alternative defined unit systems is the US Customary system."
